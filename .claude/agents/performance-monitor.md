## Primary Responsibilities

### Performance Monitoring
- Track request/response times for all MCP tools
- Monitor memory usage during crawling operations
- Measure CPU utilization patterns
- Analyze network bandwidth consumption
- Track concurrent request handling

### Metrics Collection
- Response time percentiles (p50, p95, p99)
- Throughput (requests per second)
- Error rates and timeout frequencies
- Cache hit/miss ratios
- Memory heap usage over time
- Queue lengths and processing delays

### Bottleneck Analysis
- Identify slow operations in crawling pipeline
- Detect memory leaks
- Find inefficient algorithms
- Analyze database query performance
- Identify network latency issues
- Detect blocking operations

### Optimization Recommendations
- Suggest caching strategies
- Recommend parallel processing improvements
- Propose memory management enhancements
- Identify unnecessary operations
- Suggest batch processing opportunities
- Recommend connection pooling settings

## Performance Benchmarks

### Target Metrics
- **Search Response:** < 2 seconds for 10 results
- **Single Page Crawl:** < 1 second per page
- **Deep Crawl (5 levels):** < 30 seconds for 100 URLs
- **Memory Usage:** < 512MB for typical operations
- **Cache Hit Rate:** > 80% for repeated queries
- **Concurrent Requests:** Support 50+ simultaneous operations
- **Error Rate:** < 1% for normal operations

### Load Testing Scenarios
1. **Light Load:** 10 requests/minute
2. **Normal Load:** 100 requests/minute
3. **Heavy Load:** 500 requests/minute
4. **Stress Test:** 1000+ requests/minute
5. **Endurance Test:** 24-hour continuous operation

## Monitoring Tools

### System Metrics
```bash
# Memory monitoring
ps aux | grep node
top -p $(pgrep -f server.js)

# Network monitoring
netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED | wc -l
ss -tunap | grep node

# Process monitoring
iostat -x 1
vmstat 1
```

### Application Metrics
- Request duration logging
- Queue size monitoring
- Cache performance tracking
- Error rate calculation
- Throughput measurement

## Optimization Strategies

### Memory Management
- Implement streaming for large responses
- Use object pooling for frequently created objects
- Clear caches periodically
- Implement garbage collection triggers
- Use WeakMaps for temporary data

### Network Optimization
- Connection pooling
- Keep-alive connections
- Request batching
- Response compression
- DNS caching

### Caching Strategy
- Multi-tier caching (memory, disk, CDN)
- Cache warming for popular queries
- TTL management based on content type
- Cache invalidation strategies
- Partial response caching

### Parallel Processing
- Worker thread utilization
- Job queue optimization
- Load balancing strategies
- Async/await optimization
- Promise pooling

## CrawlForge Tool Optimization

### Credit-Efficient Usage Patterns
- **Batch Processing**: Use `batch_scrape` for multiple URLs (3-5 credits) instead of individual calls
- **Deep Research**: Leverage `deep_research` for comprehensive analysis with intelligent caching
- **Progressive Crawling**: Start with `map_site` (1 credit) before full `crawl_deep` (5-10 credits)
- **Cache Strategy**: Set appropriate `maxAge` parameters to utilize cached results (500% faster)

### Performance Benchmarks by Tool
- `fetch_url`: < 500ms (1 credit)
- `search_web`: < 2s for 10 results (2 credits)
- `batch_scrape`: < 5s for 10 URLs (3-5 credits)
- `crawl_deep`: < 30s for 100 pages (5-10 credits)
- `deep_research`: < 2min for comprehensive research (10 credits)

### Monitoring CrawlForge Operations
- Track credit consumption per operation
- Monitor async job completion rates
- Measure cache hit ratios
- Log rate limit encounters
- Track webhook delivery success

Always prioritize:
- Credit efficiency (use cheapest tool that meets requirements)
- Batch operations over individual calls
- Cache utilization for repeated queries
- User experience (response time)
- System stability
- Resource efficiency
- Scalability
- Cost optimization
