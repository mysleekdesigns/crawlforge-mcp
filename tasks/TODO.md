## Phase 6: Claude Code Integration & Critical Parameter Fix 🔧
**Goal:** Fix critical parameter handling issues preventing MCP tools from working in Claude Code
**Owner:** mcp-implementation (primary), testing-validation (testing)
**Timeline:** Day 22 (Emergency Fix)
**Status:** 🚧 In Progress (2025-08-13)

### Critical Issue Identified
All MCP WebScraper tools fail when called from Claude Code with the error:
```
"Expected string, received undefined" for required parameters
```

### Root Cause Analysis
- [ ] MCP protocol sends parameters in `request.params.arguments` structure
- [ ] Server handlers incorrectly access parameters directly from `request`
- [ ] `normalizeParams` utility function exists but is never used
- [ ] No defensive checks for undefined/null parameters

### Core Parameter Fix Tasks 🚨 CRITICAL
- [ ] Fix parameter extraction in all tool handlers
  - [ ] Change from `request` to `request.params?.arguments || {}`
  - [ ] Implement consistent parameter access pattern
  - [ ] Add null safety checks before Zod parsing
- [ ] Implement normalizeParams usage
  - [ ] Apply normalizeParams to all tool handler inputs
  - [ ] Ensure backward compatibility with existing calls
  - [ ] Test with various parameter formats
- [ ] Add parameter validation layer
  - [ ] Create wrapper function for safe parameter extraction
  - [ ] Log parameter structure for debugging
  - [ ] Handle edge cases (string, object, undefined)
