**Sections:**
- Security testing overview
- Vulnerability reporting procedures
- Security configuration guidelines
- Incident response procedures
- Compliance and standards information

### 4. Updated Documentation (`CLAUDE.md`)
**Changes Made:**
- Added security testing commands section
- Documented CI/CD security integration
- Added local security testing instructions
- Included artifact and reporting information

## Security Test Coverage

### Application Security Tests
- **SSRF Protection**: Validates protection against Server-Side Request Forgery
- **Input Validation**: Tests XSS, SQL injection, command injection prevention
- **Rate Limiting**: Ensures proper rate limiting implementation
- **DoS Protection**: Validates protection against denial-of-service attacks
- **Regex DoS**: Prevents ReDoS vulnerabilities

### Dependency Security
- **npm audit**: Automated vulnerability scanning with severity thresholds
- **License compliance**: Identifies problematic software licenses
- **Outdated packages**: Detects packages needing security updates
- **Dependency analysis**: Deep analysis of direct and transitive dependencies

### Static Code Analysis
- **CodeQL**: GitHub's semantic code analysis for security vulnerabilities
- **ESLint Security**: Automated detection of insecure coding patterns
- **Secret Detection**: Scans for hardcoded API keys, passwords, tokens
- **File Security**: Checks for sensitive files in repository

### Container Security
- **Trivy Scanning**: Comprehensive container vulnerability scanning
- **SARIF Integration**: Security findings uploaded to GitHub Security tab
- **Base Image Analysis**: Regular security assessment of Docker base images

## Security Thresholds and Policies

### Build Failure Conditions
- **Critical vulnerabilities**: Any critical severity issues fail the build
- **High severity limit**: More than 3 high-severity vulnerabilities fail the build
- **Security test failures**: Any failing security tests block the build

### Automated Actions
- **Daily scans**: Comprehensive security scanning at 2 AM UTC
- **Issue creation**: Automatic GitHub issues for critical vulnerabilities
- **PR blocking**: Security failures prevent merge
- **Report generation**: Detailed security reports for every scan

## Generated Reports and Artifacts

### Report Types
1. **SECURITY-REPORT.md**: Comprehensive security assessment summary
2. **npm-audit.json**: Detailed vulnerability data in JSON format
3. **security-tests.log**: Complete security test execution logs
4. **dependency-analysis.md**: Package security and license analysis
5. **vulnerability-summary.md**: High-level vulnerability overview

### Artifact Retention
- **CI security results**: 30 days retention
- **Comprehensive reports**: 90 days retention
- **Critical vulnerability reports**: Long-term storage

## Usage Instructions

### Local Security Testing
```bash
# Run complete security test suite
npm run test:security

# Check dependencies for vulnerabilities
npm audit --audit-level moderate

# Fix automatically resolvable issues
npm audit fix

# Check for outdated packages
npm outdated
```

### Manual Security Scans
```bash
# Trigger comprehensive security scan
gh workflow run security.yml --field scan_type=all

# Dependency scan only
gh workflow run security.yml --field scan_type=dependencies

# Custom severity threshold
gh workflow run security.yml --field severity_threshold=high
```

### Reviewing Security Results
1. **PR Comments**: Security summaries automatically posted to PRs
2. **Workflow Artifacts**: Download detailed reports from Actions tab
3. **GitHub Issues**: Critical vulnerabilities create tracked issues
4. **Security Tab**: CodeQL findings appear in repository Security tab

## Integration Benefits

### Automated Security
- **Early Detection**: Security issues caught in development
- **Consistent Scanning**: Automated daily and per-PR security checks
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Multiple security analysis types
- **Actionable Reports**: Clear guidance for remediation

### Development Workflow
- **PR Integration**: Security status visible before merge
- **Blocking Builds**: Critical issues prevent deployment
- **Developer Guidance**: Clear instructions for fixing issues
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive security procedures

### Compliance and Monitoring
- **Audit Trail**: Complete security scan history
- **Policy Enforcement**: Consistent security standards
- **Vulnerability Tracking**: GitHub issue integration
- **Reporting**: Regular security posture assessment

## Best Practices for Contributors
