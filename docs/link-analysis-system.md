# Link Analysis System

## Overview

The Link Analysis System is a comprehensive graph-based analysis toolkit built for the MCP WebScraper project. It provides advanced link analysis capabilities including PageRank calculation, cycle detection, path analysis, and various graph export formats.

## Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. LinkAnalyzer (`/src/core/analysis/LinkAnalyzer.js`)
The main analysis engine that builds and analyzes directed graphs from web link data.

**Key Features:**
- Directed graph data structure with efficient node/edge storage
- Simplified PageRank algorithm implementation
- Circular reference detection using depth-first search
- Shortest path finding with BFS
- Multiple export formats (JSON, DOT, CSV, Adjacency Matrix)
- Performance optimizations with caching and memoization

#### 2. BFSCrawler Integration
Enhanced web crawler with built-in link analysis capabilities.

**Integration Points:**
- Automatic link metadata extraction during crawling
- Real-time graph building as pages are discovered
- Link importance calculation for crawl prioritization
- Comprehensive analysis results in crawl output

#### 3. LinkAnalyzerTool (`/src/tools/analysis/linkAnalyzer.js`)
High-level tool for advanced link analysis operations.

**Capabilities:**
- Standalone link analysis from data
- Bulk analysis and merging of multiple crawl results
- Comparative analysis between different datasets
- Visualization data generation
- SEO and structural recommendations

## Algorithm Details

### PageRank Implementation

The system implements a simplified PageRank algorithm:

```
PR(A) = (1-d)/N + d * Î£(PR(T)/C(T))
```

Where:
- `PR(A)` = PageRank of page A
- `d` = damping factor (default: 0.85)
- `N` = total number of pages
- `T` = pages linking to A
- `C(T)` = number of outbound links from page T

**Configuration Options:**
- `dampingFactor`: Controls random jump probability (0.0 - 1.0)
- `maxIterations`: Maximum calculation iterations (default: 100)
- `convergenceThreshold`: Convergence criteria (default: 0.0001)

### Cycle Detection

Uses depth-first search with recursion stack tracking:

**Features:**
- Detects all strongly connected components
- Configurable maximum cycle length
- Cycle strength calculation based on link frequency
- Metadata extraction for cycle analysis

### Path Analysis

Implements breadth-first search for shortest path finding:

**Options:**
- Maximum search depth limiting
- Bidirectional search capability
- Path metadata extraction
- Common ancestor identification

## Usage Examples

### Basic Integration with BFSCrawler

```javascript
import { BFSCrawler } from './src/core/crawlers/BFSCrawler.js';

const crawler = new BFSCrawler({
  maxDepth: 3,
  maxPages: 100,
  enableLinkAnalysis: true,
  linkAnalyzerOptions: {
    dampingFactor: 0.85,
    maxIterations: 100,
    enableCaching: true
  }
});

const results = await crawler.crawl('https://example.com');
console.log('Link Analysis Results:', results.linkAnalysis);
```

### Advanced Standalone Analysis

```javascript
import { LinkAnalyzerTool } from './src/tools/analysis/linkAnalyzer.js';

const tool = new LinkAnalyzerTool();
const analysis = await tool.analyze({
  links_data: [
    { from: 'https://a.com', to: 'https://b.com', metadata: { anchorText: 'Link' }},
    // ... more links
  ],
  enable_importance_calculation: true,
  enable_cycle_detection: true,
  export_format: 'json'
});
```

### Graph Export and Visualization

```javascript
// Export to various formats
const jsonData = analyzer.exportGraph('json', { includeMetadata: true });
const dotGraph = analyzer.exportGraph('dot', { includeImportance: true });
const csvData = analyzer.exportGraph('csv');
const adjacencyMatrix = analyzer.exportGraph('adjacency');

// Generate visualization data
const vizData = tool.generateVisualizationData(analyzer, {
  maxNodes: 50,
  minImportance: 0.01,
  layoutAlgorithm: 'force_directed'
});
```

## Export Formats

### JSON Format
Complete graph representation with nodes and links:

```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "https://example.com",
      "url": "https://example.com",
      "domain": "example.com",
      "importance": 0.2534,
      "metadata": { ... }
    }
  ],
  "links": [
    {
      "source": "https://example.com",
      "target": "https://example.com/about",
      "count": 3,
      "metadata": {
        "anchorText": "About Us",
        "context": "Learn more about our company..."
      }
    }
  ],
  "statistics": { ... }
}
```

### DOT Format (Graphviz)
For creating visual network diagrams:

```dot
digraph LinkGraph {
  rankdir=LR;
  node [shape=ellipse];
  
  "https://example.com" [label="example.com\n0.253"];
  "https://example.com/about" [label="example.com\n0.124"];
  
  "https://example.com" -> "https://example.com/about";
}
```

### CSV Format
Tabular data for spreadsheet analysis:

```csv
source,target,count,source_importance,target_importance,anchor_text
https://example.com,https://example.com/about,1,0.2534,0.1245,About Us
```

### Adjacency Matrix
Mathematical representation for advanced analysis:

```javascript
{
  nodes: ["https://example.com", "https://example.com/about"],
  matrix: [[0, 1], [0, 0]],
  size: 2
}
```
